# Knowledge Graph Completion using Structural and Textual Embeddings
Following are the steps to reproduce the results in our model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- PtyTorch 2.1
- Networkx 2.8
- TQDM 4

**Install Requirements**
```
python3 -m pip install torch==2.1*
python3 -m pip install networkx==2.8*
python3 -m pip install tqdm
```

## Pre-trained Language Model
* Our model achieves its best performance using **Glove word representation** (6B tokens, 400K vocab, uncased, 300d vectors)
